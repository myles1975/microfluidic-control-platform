# microfluidic-control-platform

A Python-based full-stack microfluidic control platform for cell-culture experiments, featuring a TCP/IP client-server architecture, real-time Tkinter GUI with live data plotting, and seamless integration with custom hardware peripherals on Raspberry Pi designed at the Tufts Advanced Integrated Circuits and Systems Lab.


ðŸš€ Project Overview

Purpose: Automate and monitor microfluidic experiments by controlling solenoid valves, heaters, thermocouples, and impedance measurement circuits mounted on a microscope-compatible PCB.

Host Hardware: Raspberry Pi running custom PCB peripherals.

Emulation: Includes a PressureEmulator for development and testing when real hardware is unavailable, as well as a RealPressureController for live experiments.

controller.py

PressureEmulator & RealPressureController

Abstracts pressure control, allowing seamless switching between emulation and real hardware.

Provides metadata and validation for pressure ranges (0â€“200 psi).


server_backend.py

LoSServer class listens on a TCP socket, receives commands, and interfaces with hardware controllers.

Handles low-level I/O, error checking, and response formatting.


client.py

Client class orchestrates experiment flow: sends commands, polls sensors, logs data, and handles multithreading.

Supports both interactive command-line use and file-driven automation.


interface.py

Interface class builds a Tkinter GUI with:

Live plotting of temperature, pressure, and impedance (via Matplotlib).

Real-time status indicators and error dialogs.

File upload panel for batch commands.

Buttons for manual control.


Key Features

Dual-Mode Pressure Control: PressureEmulator for CI/testing, RealPressureController for in-lab use.

TCP/IP Client-Server: Robust communication layer enabling remote control and monitoring.

Real-Time Visualization: Live graphs of P1/P2 (psi), temperature (Â°C), and impedance (R & Î˜).

File-Based Automation: Batch-execute experiments from formatted text files:

# p1 p2 time v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8
 20 30   10 1  0  1  0  0  1  1  0

Safety Failsafes: Automatic shutoff at 55Â°C, input validation, and user warnings.

Modular & Testable: Clear separation of concerns enables easy unit testing and CI integration.


How to Use Controller

Start the Server (on the Raspberry Pi)

python server_backend.py <PI_IP>

<PI_IP> is the Raspberry Piâ€™s IP address.

Run the Controller (on your CPU)

python controller.py <PI_IP>

Kill the Server (graceful shutdown)

Open a Python interpreter on your CPU:

python

Execute:

from client import Client
client = Client("<PI_IP>")
client.kill_server()
