How to Use Controller:

    - on raspbery pi run... 

        python server_backend.py ip 

      where ip is the ip of the pi

    - on CPU run... 

        python controller.py ip
        
      where ip is the ip of the pi

How to Kill Server:

    - on CPU, start python interpreter by typing python into terminal
    - type the following

        from client import Client
        client = client("ip")
        client.kill_server()

      where ip is the ip of the pi

Files that are used:

    Raspberry Pi:
        - server_backend.py: recieves commands from CPU and calls appropiate
        functions
        - labonscope.py: alters and anylyzes board state
        - ad5933.py (in eisb foler): alters and analyzes frequency board 

    CPU:
        - controller.py: main file 
        - interface.py: tkinter window
        - client.py: performs operations and sends adn recieves info from server
        (user can use through python interpreter)
        - eis_board_class.py: sends commands to server to controll frequency 
        board
        - pressure_controller.py: alters and analyzes state of pressure
        controller
